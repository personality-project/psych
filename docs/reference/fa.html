    <h1>Exploratory Factor analysis using MinRes (minimum residual) as well as EFA by Principal Axis, Weighted Least Squares or Maximum Likelihood</h1>
    </div>

    
    <p>Among the many ways to do latent variable exploratory factor analysis (EFA), one of the better is to use Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) to find the minimum residual (minres) solution. This produces solutions very similar to maximum likelihood even for badly behaved matrices. A variation on minres is to do weighted least squares (WLS). Perhaps the most conventional technique is principal axes (PAF).  An eigen value decomposition of a correlation matrix is done and then the communalities for each variable are estimated by the first n factors. These communalities are entered onto the diagonal and the procedure is repeated until the sum(diag(r)) does not vary.   Yet another estimate procedure is maximum likelihood. For well behaved matrices, maximum likelihood factor analysis (either in the fa or in the factanal function) is probably preferred.  Bootstrapped confidence intervals of the loadings and interfactor correlations are found by fa  with n.iter &gt; 1.</p>

    <h2 class="hasAnchor" id="details"><a class="anchor" href="#details"></a>Details</h2>

    <p>Factor analysis is an attempt to approximate a correlation or covariance matrix with one of lesser rank.  The basic model is that \(_nR_n \approx _{n}F_{kk}F_n'+ U^2\) where k is much less than n. There are many ways to do factor analysis, and maximum likelihood procedures are probably the most commonly preferred (see <code>factanal</code> ).  The existence of uniquenesses is what distinguishes factor analysis from principal components analysis (e.g., <code><a href='principal.html'>principal</a></code>). If variables are thought to represent a ``true" or latent part then factor analysis provides an estimate of the correlations with the latent factor(s) representing the data.  If variables are thought to be measured without error, then principal components provides the most parsimonious description of the data.</p>
<p>Factor loadings will be smaller than component loadings for the later reflect unique error in each variable. The off diagonal residuals for a factor solution will be superior (smaller)  that of a component model.  Factor loadings can be thought of as the asymptotic component loadings as the number of variables loading on each factor increases.</p>
<p>The fa function will do factor analyses using one of five different algorithms: minimum residual (minres, aka ols, uls), principal axes, weighted least squares, minimum rank, or maximum likelihood.</p>
<p>Principal axes factor analysis has a long history in exploratory analysis and is a straightforward procedure.  Successive eigen value decompositions are done on a correlation matrix with the diagonal replaced with  diag (FF') until \(\sum(diag(FF'))\) does not change (very much).  The current limit of max.iter =50 seems to work for most problems, but the Holzinger-Harmon 24 variable problem needs about 203 iterations to converge for a 5 factor solution.</p>
<p>Not all factor programs that do principal axes do iterative solutions.  The example from the SAS manual (Chapter 33) is such a case. To achieve that solution, it is necessary to specify that the max.iter = 1.  Comparing that solution to an iterated one (the default) shows that iterations improve the solution.</p>
<p>In addition, fm="mle" produces even better solutions for this example.  Both the RMSEA and the root mean square of the residuals are smaller than the fm="pa" solution.</p>
<p>However, simulations of multiple problem sets suggest that fm="pa" tends to produce slightly smaller residuals while having slightly larger RMSEAs than does fm="minres" or fm="mle".    That is, the sum of squared residuals for fm="pa" seem to be slightly smaller than those found using fm="minres" but the RMSEAs are slightly worse when using fm="pa".  That is to say, the "true" minimal residual is probably found by fm="pa".</p>
<p>Following extensive correspondence with Hao Wu and Mikko Ronkko, in April, 2017 the derivative of the minres  and uls) fitting was modified.  This leads to slightly smaller residuals (appropriately enough for a method claiming to minimize them) than the prior procedure.  For  consistency with prior analyses, "old.min" was added to give these slightly larger residuals.  The differences between old.min and the newer "minres" and "ols" solutions are at the third to fourth decimal, but none the less, are worth noting. For comparison purposes, the fm="ols" uses empirical first derivatives, while uls and minres use equation based first derivatives.  The results seem to be identical, but the minres and uls solutions require fewer iterations for larger problems and are faster. Thanks to Hao Wu for some very thoughtful help.</p>
<p>Principal axes may be used in cases when maximum likelihood solutions fail to converge, although fm="minres" will also do that and tends to produce better (smaller RMSEA) solutions.</p>
<p>The fm="minchi" option is a variation on the "minres" (ols) solution and minimizes the sample size weighted residuals rather than just the residuals. This was developed to handle the problem of data that Massively Missing Completely at Random (MMCAR) which a condition that happens in the SAPA project.</p>
    <p>A problem in factor analysis is to find the best estimate of the original communalities.  Using the Squared Multiple Correlation (SMC) for each variable will underestimate the communalities, using 1s will over estimate.  By default, the SMC estimate is used.  In either case, iterative techniques will tend to converge on a stable solution. If, however, a solution fails to be achieved, it is useful to try again using ones (SMC =FALSE).  Alternatively, a vector of starting values for the communalities may be specified by the SMC option.</p>
<p>The iterated principal axes algorithm does not attempt to find the best (as defined by a maximum likelihood criterion) solution, but rather one that converges rapidly using successive eigen value decompositions.  The maximum likelihood criterion of fit and the associated chi square value are reported, and will be worse than that found using maximum likelihood procedures.</p>
<p>The minimum residual (minres) solution is an unweighted least squares solution that takes a slightly different approach.  It uses the <code>optim</code> function and adjusts the diagonal elements of the correlation matrix to mimimize the squared residual when the factor model is the eigen value decomposition of the reduced matrix.  MINRES and PA will both work when ML will not, for they can be used when the matrix is singular. Although before the change in the derivative,  the MINRES solution was slightly more similar to the ML solution than is the PA solution. With the change in the derivative of the minres fit, the minres, pa and uls solutions are practically identical. To a great extent, the minres and wls solutions follow ideas in the <code>factanal</code> function with the change in the derivative.</p>
<p>The weighted least squares (wls) solution weights the residual matrix by 1/ diagonal of the inverse of the correlation matrix.  This has the effect of weighting items with low communalities more than those with high communalities.</p>
<p>The generalized least squares (gls) solution weights the residual matrix by the inverse of the correlation matrix.  This has the effect of weighting those variables with low communalities even more than those with high communalities.</p>
<p>The maximum likelihood solution takes yet another approach and finds those communality values that minimize the chi square goodness of fit test.  The fm="ml" option provides a maximum likelihood solution following the procedures used in <code>factanal</code> but does not provide all the extra features of that function.</p>
<p>The minimum rank factor model (MRFA) roughly follows ideas by Shapiro and Ten Berge (2002) and Ten Berge and Kiers (1991).  It makes use of the glb.algebraic procedure contributed by Andreas Moltner.  MRFA attempts to extract factors such that the residual matrix is still positive semi-definite.  This version is still being tested and feedback is most welcome.</p>
<p>Test cases comparing the output to SPSS suggest that the PA algorithm matches what SPSS calls uls, and that the wls solutions are equivalent in their fits. The wls and gls solutions have slightly larger eigen values, but slightly worse fits of the off diagonal residuals than do the minres or maximum likelihood solutions.  Comparing the results to the examples in Harman (76), the PA solution with no iterations matches what Harman calls Principal Axes (as does SAS), while the iterated PA solution matches his minres solution.  The minres solution found in psych tends to have slightly smaller off diagonal residuals (as it should) than does the iterated PA solution.</p>
<p>Although for items, it is typical to find factor scores by scoring the salient items (using, e.g., <code><a href='score.items.html'>scoreItems</a></code>) factor scores can be estimated by regression as well as several other means. There are multiple approaches that are possible (see Grice, 2001) and the one taken here was developed by tenBerge et al.  (see <code><a href='factor.scores.html'>factor.scores</a></code>. The alternative, which will match factanal is to find the scores using regression --  Thurstone's least squares regression where the weights are found by   \(W = R^(-1)S\) where R is the correlation matrix of the variables ans S is the structure matrix.  Then, factor scores are just \(Fs = X W\).</p>
<p>In the oblique case, the factor loadings are referred to as Pattern coefficients and are related to the Structure coefficients by \(S = P \Phi\) and thus \(P = S \Phi^{-1}\).  When estimating factor scores, <code>fa</code> and  <code>factanal</code> differ in that <code>fa</code> finds the factors from the Structure matrix while <code>factanal</code> seems to do it from the Pattern matrix.  Thus, although in the orthogonal case, fa and factanal agree perfectly in their factor score estimates, they do not agree in the case of oblique factors.  Setting oblique.scores = TRUE  will produce factor score estimate that match those of <code>factanal</code>.</p>
<p>It is sometimes useful to extend the factor solution to variables that were not factored.  This may be done using <code><a href='fa.extension.html'>fa.extension</a></code>. Factor extension is typically done in the case where some variables were not appropriate to factor, but factor loadings on the original factors are still desired.</p>
<p>For dichotomous items or polytomous items, it is recommended to analyze the <code><a href='tetrachor.html'>tetrachoric</a></code> or <code><a href='tetrachor.html'>polychoric</a></code> correlations rather than the Pearson correlations. This may be done by specifying cor="poly" or cor="tet" or cor="mixed" if the data have a mixture of dichotomous, polytomous, and continous variables.</p>
<p>Analysis of dichotomous or polytomous data may also be done by using  <code><a href='irt.fa.html'>irt.fa</a></code> or simply setting the cor="poly" option.  In the first case,  the factor analysis results are reported in Item Response Theory (IRT) terms, although the original factor solution is returned in the results. In the later case, a typical factor loadings matrix is returned, but the tetrachoric/polychoric correlation matrix and item statistics are saved for reanalysis by <code><a href='irt.fa.html'>irt.fa</a></code>. (See also the <code><a href='mixed.cor.html'>mixed.cor</a></code> function to find correlations from a mixture of continuous, dichotomous, and polytomous items.)</p>
    <p>Of the various rotation/transformation options, varimax, Varimax, quartimax, bentlerT, geominT, and bifactor do orthogonal rotations. Promax  transforms obliquely with a target matix equal to the varimax solution. oblimin, quartimin, simplimax,  bentlerQ,  geominQ and biquartimin are oblique transformations. Most of these are just calls to  the GPArotation package. The ``cluster'' option does a targeted rotation to a structure defined by the cluster representation of a varimax solution.  With the optional "keys" parameter, the "target" option will rotate to a target supplied as a keys matrix. (See <code><a href='Promax.html'>target.rot</a></code>.)</p>
<p>Two additional target rotation options are available through calls to GPArotation.  These are the targetQ (oblique) and targetT (orthogonal) target rotations of Michael Browne.  See <code><a href='Promax.html'>target.rot</a></code> for more documentation.</p>
<p>The "bifactor" rotation implements the Jennrich and Bentler (2011) bifactor rotation by calling the GPForth function in the GPArotation package and using two functions adapted from  the MatLab code of Jennrich and Bentler.  This seems to have a problem with local minima and multiple starting values should be used.</p>
<p>There are two varimax rotation functions.  One, Varimax, in the GPArotation package does not by default apply Kaiser normalization.  The other, varimax, in the stats package, does.  It appears that the two rotation functions produce slightly different results even when normalization is set. For consistency with the other rotation functions, Varimax is probably preferred.</p>
<p>The rotation matrix  (rot.mat) is returned from all of these options. This is the inverse of the Th (theta?) object returned by the GPArotation package.  The correlations of the factors may be found by \(\Phi = \theta' \theta\)</p>
<p>There are two ways to handle dichotomous or polytomous responses: <code>fa</code> with the cor="poly" option which will return the tetrachoric or polychoric correlation matrix, as well as the normal factor analysis output, and <code><a href='irt.fa.html'>irt.fa</a></code> which returns a two parameter irt analysis as well as the normal fa output.</p>
<p>When factor analyzing items with dichotomous or polytomous responses, the <code><a href='irt.fa.html'>irt.fa</a></code> function provides an Item Response Theory representation of the factor output. The factor analysis results are available, however, as an object in the irt.fa output.
    <code><a href='deprecated.html'>fa.poly</a></code> is deprecated, for its functioning is matched by setting cor="poly".  It will produce normal factor analysis output but also will save the polychoric matrix  (rho) and items difficulties (tau) for subsequent irt analyses.  <code><a href='deprecated.html'>fa.poly</a></code> will,  by default, find factor scores if the data are available.  The correlations are found using either <code><a href='tetrachor.html'>tetrachoric</a></code> or <code><a href='tetrachor.html'>polychoric</a></code> and then this matrix is factored.  Weights from the factors are then applied to the original data to estimate factor scores.</p>
<p>The function <code>fa</code> will repeat the analysis n.iter times on a bootstrapped sample of the data (if they exist) or of a simulated data set based upon the observed correlation matrix.  The mean estimate and standard deviation of the estimate are returned and will print the original factor analysis as well as the alpha level confidence intervals for the estimated coefficients.  The bootstrapped solutions are rotated towards the original solution using target.rot. The factor loadings are z-transformed, averaged and then back transformed. This leads to an error in the case of Heywood cases.  The probably better alternative is to just find the mean bootstrapped value and find the confidence intervals based upon the observed range of values. The default is to have n.iter =1 and thus not do bootstrapping.</p>
<p>If using polytomous or dichotomous items, it is perhaps more useful is to find the Item Response Theory parameters equivalent to the factor loadings reported in fa.poly by using the <code><a href='irt.fa.html'>irt.fa</a></code> function.</p>
<p>Some correlation matrices that arise from using pairwise deletion or from tetrachoric or polychoric matrices will not be proper.  That is, they will not be positive semi-definite (all eigen values &gt;= 0).  The <code><a href='cor.smooth.html'>cor.smooth</a></code> function will adjust correlation matrices (smooth them) by making all negative eigen values slightly greater than 0, rescaling the other eigen values to sum to the number of variables, and then recreating the correlation matrix.  See <code><a href='cor.smooth.html'>cor.smooth</a></code> for an example of this problem using the <code><a href='burt.html'>burt</a></code> data set.</p>
<p>For those who like SPSS type output, the measure of factoring adequacy known as the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin <code><a href='KMO.html'>KMO</a></code> test may be found from the correlation matrix or data matrix using the <code><a href='KMO.html'>KMO</a></code> function.  Similarly, the Bartlett's test of Sphericity may be found using the  <code><a href='cortest.bartlett.html'>cortest.bartlett</a></code> function.</p>
<p>For those who want to have an object of the variances accounted for, this is returned invisibly by the print function.  (e.g., p &lt;- print(fa(ability))$Vaccounted ).  This is now returned by the fa function as well (e.g. p &lt;- fa(ability)$Vaccounted ).</p>
<p>The output from the print.psych.fa function displays the factor loadings (from the pattern matrix, the h2 (communalities) the u2 (the uniquenesses), com (the complexity of the factor loadings for that variable (see below).  In the case of an orthogonal solution, h2 is merely the row sum of the squared factor loadings. But for an oblique solution, it is the row sum of the orthogonal factor loadings (remember, that rotations or transformations do not change the communality).</p>

    <h2 class="hasAnchor" id="note"><a class="anchor" href="#note"></a>Note</h2>

    <p>Thanks to Erich Studerus for some very helpful suggestions about various rotation and factor scoring algorithms, and to  Gumundur Arnkelsson  for suggestions about factor scores for singular matrices.</p>
<p>The fac function is the original fa function which is now called by fa repeatedly to get confidence intervals.</p>
<p>SPSS will sometimes use a Kaiser normalization before rotating.  This will lead to different solutions than reported here.  To get the Kaiser normalized loadings, use <code><a href='kaiser.html'>kaiser</a></code>.</p>
<p>The communality for a variable is the amount of variance accounted for by all of the factors.  That is to say, for orthogonal factors, it is the sum of the squared factor loadings (rowwise).  The communality is insensitive to rotation.  However, if an oblique solution is found, then the communality is not the sum of squared pattern coefficients. In both cases (oblique or orthogonal) the communality is the diagonal of the reproduced correlation matrix where \(_nR_n =  _{n}P_{k  k}\Phi_{k k}P_n'\)  where P is the pattern matrix and \(\Phi\) is the factor intercorrelation matrix.     This is the same, of course to multiplying the pattern by the structure: \(R = P S'\) R = PS' where the Structure matrix is \(S = \Phi P\). Similarly, the eigen values are the diagonal of the product \( _k\Phi_{kk}P'_{nn}P_{k}
\).</p>
<p>A frequently asked question is why are the factor names of the rotated solution not in ascending order?  That is, for example, if factoring the 25 items of the bfi, the factor names are MR2   MR3   MR5   MR1   MR4, rather than the seemingly more logical  "MR1" "MR2" "MR3" "MR4" "MR5".  This is for pedagogical reasons, in that factors as extracted are orthogonal and are in order of amount of variance accounted for.  But when rotated (orthogonally) or transformed (obliquely) the simple structure solution does not preserve that order. The factors are still ordered according to variance accounted for, but because rotation changes how much variance each factor explains, the order may not the be the same as the original order.  The factor names are, of course, arbitrary, and are kept with the original names to show the effect of rotation/transformation.  To give them names associated with their ordinal position, simply paste("F", 1:nf, sep="") where nf is the number of factors. See the last example.</p>
<p>The print function for the fa output will return (invisibly) an object (Vaccounted) that matches the printed output for the variance accounted for by each factor, as well as the cumulative variance, and the percentage of variance accounted for by each factor.</p>
<p>Correction to documentation: as of September, 2014, the oblique.scores option is correctly explained. (It had been backwards.)  The default (oblique.scores=FALSE) finds scores based upon the Structure matrix, while oblique.scores=TRUE finds them based upon the pattern matrix.  The latter case matches factanal.  This error was detected by Mark Seeto.</p>
<p>If the raw data are factored, factors scores are found.  By default this will be done using 'regression' but alternatives are available. Although the scores are found by multiplying the standardized data by the weights, if using regression, the resulting factor scores will not necessarily have unit variance.</p>
<p>The minimum residual solution is done by finding those communalities that will minimize the off diagonal residual. The uls solution finds those communalities that minimize the total residuals.</p>
<p>The minres solution has been modified (April, 2107) following suggestions by Hao Wu. Although the fitting function was the minimal residual, the first derivative of the fitting function was incorrect. This has now been modified so that the results match those of SPSS and CEFA.  The prior solutions are still available using fm="old.min".</p>
